# Eloquence-Enhancer
Perpetuately upholded pinnacle of uncompromised formality.

_Have you ever felt your piece of text, essay, article, e-mail, just does not have enought weight because it lacks some truly formal phrases? Have you ever felt that a better way of phrasing something is just on the tip of your tongue, but you can't quite recollect it? Have you ever wanted to not just say, but state something that will resonate with your audience?_

If only you had something to enhance your eloquence... Judge for yourself, doesn't the above sound more serious if written in this way:

_Have you ever perceived a deficiency in gravitas within your written work—be it an essay, article, or correspondence—stemming from an absence of suitably formal expressions? Have you encountered moments wherein the optimal articulation of a thought or concept seems elusive, merely hovering at the edge of your consciousness, yet remains frustratingly out of reach? Have you aspired to articulate, not merely express, a sentiment or argument with such persuasive power that it unequivocally resonates with your intended audience?_

Eloquence Enhancer is here to save your day. Or, as it would state it, to avert a critical situation.

ABOUT EE:
A simple Python app using langchain and OpenAI's API, terminal-based. Returns correct input whether inputted a word, phrase or even longer piece of text. Never tested its capabilities in terms of input length, so I can't tell where the limit is.

Have fun!

# Requirements:
- Just your copy of OpenAI API key
